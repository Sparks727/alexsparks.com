Hello everyone, this is Alex Sparks. Your Google Business Profile (GBP) is a major component of local SEO, which is essential for any company hoping to succeed in the modern digital environment. Location is one of the most neglected elements in GBP optimization and its crutial to get it right the first time because your exposure in local searches is greatly impacted by the location you choose.  Based on my experience working with companies of all sizes, I'll offer some tips in this article on how to choose the best location for your GBP.
## Why Location Matters

When ranking GBP listings, Google's algorithm takes proximity into account. When someone searches for "pizza near me," Google gives preference to establishments that are physically nearby. Your rankings may suffer if you open a business location that is too remote from the city center. Working with clients has shown me that even a slight change in location may have a significant effect on exposure.

## Useful Advice before Selecting Your GBP Location:

1. Keyword Research: Prior to doing anything, conduct keyword research to find out where your target audience is searching. Investigate location-based keywords using tools such as Google's Keyword Planner or Semrush's Google Keyword Research Tool.
2. Analyze your competitors: Find the locations of your main rivals. Are they grouped together in one place? This can point to a place with a lot of demand or traffic but can also be more difficult to rank due to saturation. 
3. Avoid Share Spaces: Google is getting better at identifying fake business locations, even if they may appear to be a cheap & quick way to obtain a city center location you could get suspended for using a virtual office or shared space.

## Getting Started with Accurate Software

By entering a city name, the software will calculate and display the city center based on geographic coordinates sourced from Wikipedia.

Remember: Open your Google Business Profile in a location that is not too far from the city center because Google considers how far each potential search result is from the location term used in a search.
